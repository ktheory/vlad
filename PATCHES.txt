This file outlines how ktheory-vlad (http://github.com/ktheory/vlad) differs
from seattlerb's vlad (http://hitsquad.rubyforge.org/vlad/) and vlad-git
(http://github.com/jbarnette/vlad-git)

Changes from vlad-2.0 (http://hitsquad.rubyforge.org/vlad/):

* Include modules from vlad-1.4 that were removed in vlad-2.0.
  In 2.0, seattlerb chose to remove modules for common web servers and SCMs
  except apache, passenger, and subversion (vlad's defaults). The removed
  modules must be installed seperately, but are difficult to find. See commit
  a2b92b4ffdfb8748898289de96d8b84860122468

* Fix vlad:start_app passenger task when run without a full deployment.
  See http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=26003&group_id=4213&atid=16258
  and commit 82dccf88de1561369ef5089151a58345a236e2c9

* Added the ability to prefix output with hostnames (or a custom string).
  See http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=20768&group_id=4213&atid=16261
  and commit 7b6522df086f5e1c28d585483b9c74eb1fa660e5

Changes from vlad-git-2.1.0 (http://github.com/jbarnette/vlad-git):

* Use fast checkouts when possible insteading cloning the entire repo. (This
  is an unreleased feature of vlad-git) See http://github.com/jbarnette/vlad-git/commit/749ab8f9bb7c24baafdd513a5b9d8246fc0a7f5a

* Fixes submodule initializes for git version < 1.5.6. See commit
